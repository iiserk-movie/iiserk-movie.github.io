<strong>Genre</strong>: Drama, Crime, Thriller<br>
<strong>Run Time</strong>: 131 min</p>
<ol start="1986">
<li>In a rural district of South Korea, two women have been recently raped and murdered. Working on the case are detectives Park Doo-man and Cho Yong-koo. Their efforts are impeded by some sloppy crime scene procedure by the police. Their methods of solving cases are also quite basic, essentially amounting to beating confessions out of suspects. All this leads to nothing and the police chief brings in a more sophisticated and intelligent detective from Seoul, Seo Tae-yoon. With his arrival the methods improve but they still don&rsquo;t have the killer. Then another woman is found murdered and a pattern emerges.</li>
</ol>
<p>And now for the special!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Cloud and the Man&rdquo; is the story of Manik, a loner by nature and asocial by choice. He lives with his ailing father, who is nothing more than an alarm clock to him. Manik leads an uneventful life which revolves around his plants, his strays, a spider, ants, and the house lizard. Manik&rsquo;s father passes away one day and Manik is served a month&rsquo;s notice to vacate the rented house. Just when the world around him starts to fall apart, Manik meets someone that would change his life for good. He meets a cloud. Initially mistaking the cloud as a stalker, Manik soon discovers his folly. What unfolds is the most unique love story between a cloud and a man. The surreal romance brings out a new Manik in him and propels him into a roller coaster journey of faith, betrayal, belief, and warmth.</p>
