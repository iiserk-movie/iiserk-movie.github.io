  <p>Welcome back to campus! We hope that your summer was fun - but it is now time to strap in for the new semester.<br>
To help you unwind after a week of shifting rooms and cleaning, we have three amazing movies lines up for the weekend; Stories about a deranged soldier, a misled dramatist, and a (very sad) musician.</p>

<p><strong>Director</strong>: Werner Herzog<br>
<strong>Genre</strong>: Drama<br>
<strong>Run Time</strong>: 82 min</p>
<p>Everything in town appears calm, placid, lovely. But Woyzeck, a rifleman assigned as an orderly, hears voices &ndash; the times are out of joint, at least in his cosmos. To his captain, Woyzeck is a comic marvel: ignorant but courageous, full of energy to little purpose. To a local doctor, Woyzeck is a curiosity, the object of cruel study. Woyzeck, 40, has a young wife, Marie, and a small child. He dotes on them, but Marie, even though she has periods of guilt and remorse, carries on affairs and flirtations. When the captain lets drop broad hints of Woyzeck&rsquo;s being a cuckold, his inner demons and the voices of the spheres take over. Will madness bring action? Of what sort?</p>

<h2 id="reactions-from-the-audience">Reactions from the audience</h2>
<p>This movie has been given a rating of <strong>7.0/10 CGPA</strong> based on <em>2 reviews</em>! (Wow, what a large number!).<br>
Here are some reactions from the audience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unravels like a Shakespearean tragedy. Kinski lives the character as best as he always does. However this perhaps is the worst production of Herzog. From lighting to editing ― how bad could it be coming from a master.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a well-crafted movie with eerie score.<br>
The depiction of different classes is well portrayed. The movie showcases the very long oppression of Aristocrats against poors and crippling of the bourgeois class.<br>
Eva Mattes has a great performance in the film.</p>

<p><strong>Director</strong>: István Szabó<br>
<strong>Genre</strong>: Drama<br>
<strong>Run Time</strong>: 145 min</p>
<p>A German stage actor finds unexpected success and mixed blessings in the popularity of his performance in a Faustian play as the Nazis take power in pre-WWII Germany. As his associates and friends flee or are ground under by the Nazi terror, the popularity of his character supersedes his own existence until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never watched a german movie before especially from the perspective of the german civils against the Nazis.</p>
