      <description>Very rarely do I see a movie that has my eyes welling up with tears for the better part of the last act; even rarer is a Bollywood movie accomplishing this.&#xA;In an industry where ‘Kabir Singh’ exists and broke all records on opening day, ‘Thappad’ belongs to the rare breed of movies that has achieved this. Thappad is a powerhouse in itself – capably made, phenomenally executed, and refuses to pull any punches in the story it chooses to tell.</description>

      <description>I love different types of posters – my college wall is a testament to that. I have spent ages carefully curating what hangs on my wall, I have seen many posters, using the best digital nuances, illustrations and typography, but never have I seen anything that has shaken me this much.&#xA;It’s a simple poster, to be sure, but it is something I will carry with me for a very long time.</description>

      <description>Navigating through Kolkata on a rainy November day to catch the Cat Sticks premiere was quite a task, with the traffic more arduous than usual, the rains incessant and heavy, and the passes at Nandan frequently running out. But the crowd at Nandan 1 spoke a different story at sundown — hundreds of people had turned up with umbrellas, waiting in queue in the downpour for more than an hour to attend the first ever Kolkata premiere for Cat Sticks.</description>

      <title>Review: Summer Wars</title>

      <description>“Never turn your back on family, especially when they hurt you”&#xA;Summer Wars, is practically speaking, not the first movie that comes to mind when one thinks of director Mamoru Hosoda, especially when there’s The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. But in many ways Summer Wars crosses conventional stereotypes of animated movies to deliver a unique perspective to Japan’s family life and how a society deeply rooted into its history transitions into the modern world.</description>

      <title>Love and Life in The Old West – The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</title>

      <description>I love the Coen Brothers. I’m a deeply cynical person and I enjoy their distinctive brand of black comedy and dark drama. …but this. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a fascinating creature to behold. It is a movie put together from bits and pieces of cinematic tropes, conventions, and clichés, including ones borrowed from a range of genres, from ingenious physical comedy to romantic lyricism to Gothic horror. But all are united by a giddy Western revisionism centering upon a common theme: the relentless cruelty, wanton violence, deadly recklessness, and cavalier abuses of unchecked power that prevailed in the thinly and casually governed Wild West.</description>

      <description>Taxi Driver, a 1976 neo-noir psychological thriller film, written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese is a first person character study of a New York City taxi driver named Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro who is well known for his distinctive method acting. The movie is narrated from the protagonist’s point of view and so if you want to enjoy the film, you have to fit yourself in his shoes.</description>

      <description>“And you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris? They call it a “Royale with Cheese.” -Vincent Vega from ‘Pulp Fiction’&#xA;As said by Roger Ebert, Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn’t care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His movies are mostly characterized by satirical subject matters, a non-linear storyline, extended scenes of dialogues and aestheticization of violence, and Pulp Fiction is the supreme emblem.</description>

      <title>The Artist – A Review</title>

      <description>‘The Sound of Silence’ could never be better conveyed than in a modern day black-and-white silent movie. Mingled with humour and drama, director Michel Hazanavicius has put forth with sheer brilliance the right ingredients to tickle not only your funny bone but also your brain, so much so that the movie could easily be mistaken for a classic. In the beautiful play of black and white, one gets to appreciate the ‘essence’ without much hindrance from ‘visual elements of color’.</description>

      <description>In view of his recent death, I remembered how Bernardo Bertolucci admitted to have shot the infamous unscripted rape scene in Last Tango in Paris with Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, the latter being kept completely in the dark about the scene because Bertolucci wanted to capture her reaction “as a girl, not as an actress”. Schneider took to drug abuse and depression surrounding the controversy that built for several years around the film, and died in 2011.</description>

      <title>Into The Wild – A Review</title>

      <description>“Happiness only real when shared”&#xA;I chose to write a review on this because this is the last film I’d watched, and of course, there are many, many aesthetic films out there, but the beauty of this one is still as fresh in my mind as the “fresh-ness” of the numerous breathtaking scenes this film immortalises.&#xA;Directed by Sean Penn this film is, first and foremost, a journey of growth, self-realisation and understanding.</description>

      <description>“Let the Devil Out”.&#xA;Full disclosure here – I am, quite possibly a 5 year old, and love anything related to superheroes. I’ve seen almost all of WB’s “Arrowverse”. I survived the short-lived DCEU. And I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the Marvel Cinematic Universe.&#xA;But, Daredevil…&#xA;…Daredevil is a rare stroke of genius in an over saturated genre. Daredevil is the entire genre at its best – from the story telling and dialogues, to the themes, choreography and character arcs, Daredevil is a masterpiece.</description>

      <description>খুব সিরিয়াস একটি আলোচনা। গোটা লেখায় মোট এগারোবার ‘প্রেক্ষিত’ শব্দটা রয়েছে, সুতরাং সিরিয়াস হতেই হবে। অর্থাৎ কিনা গুরুতর মার্ক্সীয় দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি প্রভৃতি। একখানা প্রেক্ষিত এইসব বাঁদরামো করতেই খরচ হয়ে গেল (আরেকটা গেল এখানে)। এইপ্রকার ছ্যাবলামি ভবিষ্যতে চলবে না, আমি প্রবন্ধকার হিসেবে আপনাদের কথা দিচ্ছি পরবর্তী প্রেক্ষিতগুলি অতিশয় সচেতনতা ও পরিমিতিবোধের সহিত ব্যবহৃত হইবে। প্রেক্ষিত ছাড়াও একটা ভালো শব্দ আছে – ভাষ্য, যাকে বাংলায় বলে ন্যারেটিভ। প্রবন্ধটিতে কতবার ন্যারেটিভ শব্দটি রয়েছে সেটাও একটা দেখার বিষয়। যে লেখায় যত বেশিবার ন্যারেটিভ থাকে সে লেখা তত প্রগতিশীল বলে গণ্য হয়।</description>

      <description>October is the closest that contemporary Hindi cinema has come to resembling an E. E. Cummings poem. Listen to the last verse of his famous poem – somewhere I have never travelled, gladly beyond. Cummings writes:&#xA;(I do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands)</description>

      <title>Sorry To Bother You – A Review</title>

      <description>Cassius “Cash” Green, our protagonist, and an aptly named individual is at first trying to make ends meet. He is desperate enough to lie at an interview for a telemarketer job at RegalView, where he is caught, but gets a job anyway.&#xA;The whole movie is about the struggles working class in the world of late-stage capitalism. The most popular television show is “I Got The Shit Kicked Out of Me“, in which participants come and well… get the shit kicked out of them.</description>

      <description>I remember watching Spring, summer… one summer about eight years back on UTV world movies, and getting vaguely scarred by the image of a snake swimming around a boat on which monk is setting himself on fire. Not a good first impression, I agree. But time has flown past the handrails I held closely back then, and here I am, on a re-watch schedule of everything that got me curious at that age.</description>
