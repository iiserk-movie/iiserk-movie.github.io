      <p>“Happiness only real when shared”</p>
<p>I chose to write a review on this because this is the last film I’d watched, and of course, there are many, many aesthetic films out there, but the beauty of this one is still as fresh in my mind as the “fresh-ness” of the numerous breathtaking scenes this film immortalises.</p>
<p>Directed by Sean Penn this film is, first and foremost, a journey of growth, self-realisation and understanding. The journey is as much philosophical as it is a raw, grounded one.</p>
<p>The depiction of the idea of “society” as opposed to the idea of “freedom”, the idea of attachment to familiarity as opposed to finding faith, connection and happiness in the unfamiliar are some aspects of the film that stays with you long after you’ve finished watching it.</p>
<p>There are innumerable, precious words and dialogues in the film that are sure to spark a kindred feeling in some, and provide a deep insight and new perspectives to others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’re wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from human relationships; God’s placed it all around us. It’s in everything. It’s in anything we can experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The music by Eddie Vedder balances the tempo of the film just perfectly. The cast puts up a truly inspiring performance, and Emile Hirsch’s efforts and sacrifices put into playing the role of the protagonist deserves much recognition and appreciation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/wild-1.webp" alt="Still"></p>
<p>Certain scenes in the film, such as the one where Christopher is shown to burn all his money and social identity/bank cards might be controversial and not quite believable to some; but the whole point of the film is not conforming to standard ideas of “normalcy”, but breaking free of the shackles that “normal society” and dull, weary thinking puts on you.</p>
<p>There are several touching scenes in the movie: such as the time when “Alexander Supertramp” finally finds a sense of belonging in a family of two complete strangers. Or (notwithstanding the controversy related to it) the raw, heart-wrenching emotions in the very last scene portraying his death in an abandoned “magic bus” in Alaska, where he had always wanted to go.</p>
<p>The scene that touched my soul the most is the one where Christopher stumbles upon a herd of wild reindeers galloping away, and tears of untouched happiness and the rare feeling of truly being alive flows through him. One of the many, many scenes I related to hugely.</p>
<p>I’d recommend this film to everyone, and not just because I connected to it deeply on a personal level. This film is for anyone seeking to find meaning, feel inspired, break the monotony of everyday life, gain a new perspective on their existence, discover themselves in a whole new way, or simply, to live.</p>
<p>This film is, first and foremost, a journey to the depths of humanity, accompanied by beautiful cinematography, music and screenplay, infused with an infectious verve for life. A little lengthy, but a journey worth undertaking. And I’d say, more than once.</p>
