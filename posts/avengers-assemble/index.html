      <p>From the title above it is pretty evident that the review is about a Marvel movie, especially where all the earth&rsquo;s mightiest superheroes ‘THE AVENGERS’ have assembled and saved the earth from disaster.As a huge Avengers and in general a superhero movie fan I am just going to sing praises about the movie. This review is basically I am fanboying over the movie AVENGERS INFINITY WAR.</p>
<h3 id="plot-and-characters-">PLOT AND CHARACTERS-</h3>
<p>During the last scene of Thor Ragnarok, it is shown that the Asgardians are on a ship to Earth. Infinity War starts with the same boat being attacked by the ‘purple philosophical beast’ THANOS. This was his first mission in his quest to get all the six infinity stones to achieve his goal of achieving a perfect balance (‘as all things should be’). Now to stop him the scattered and divided Avengers (following the civil war split up) have to unite along with the guardians of the galaxy to save the whole universe. Each character has its way of shining. Be it Ironman’s genius but quirky attitude, Dr Strange’s mystical antics, or Spiderman’s sheer bravery and loyalty towards his beloved “MR STARK’. The blend of the old characters with the new ones is just perfect, especially the meeting between Thor and the guardians of the galaxy. Their comedic timing was just a treat to eye well except when Thor was listing the number of people that he had lost. It was heart-wrenching, to say the least.</p>
<h3 id="visuals-and-action-">VISUALS AND ACTION-</h3>
<p>I mean come on, it&rsquo;s an Avengers movie. The name Marvel Cinematic Universe is enough to let you know that you are in for a treat to watch.</p>
<p>The vibrant landscapes of Wakanda or the now destroyed ‘purple Monster planet Titan was just spectacular. The special effect of a doctor strange doing his magic or when he is reading the possibilities where the Avengers win in the battle against Thanos or the depiction of all the other planets that are shown where Thanos goes to take the infinity stones or the epic battle scene where the iconic dialogue (BRING ME THANOS) takes place followed by an even more iconic<br>
scene. I must stop myself but there are just too many scenes to list from. Lastly ‘the purple philosophical monster.’ The depiction of Thanos was probably the best part of this movie. I mean how strong is he bhai!? If I was an Avenger I would have shit my pants just thinking of him and his abilities after getting the first two out of the six infinity stones. But on a serious note in my opinion Thanos was the actual main character of Infinity War and it was probably the best depiction of a villain in a superhero movie.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-">CONCLUSION-</h3>
<p>Overall the movie achieves what it wanted to convey. Though the film felt a little rushed through as at one time you are seeing Bucky getting his arm fixed and just another shot where you see Dr. Strange trying to capture Thanos with his mystical ropes as it tries to fit too many characters and their subplots into a movie that only has a runtime of 2hr 40 mins. But apart from that in my opinion it is one of the best superhero movies and it also makes the people from the theater leave with a heavy heart after flooding the theatres with their tears and making them eagerly wait for what is next to come. As per the general public, the movie is an 8,8.5/10 but for me it was, is and always be a 10/10 movie.</p>
